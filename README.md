# TinDog
A landing page attempting to imitate Tinder 

TinDog was my introduction to basic HTML and CSS (with a touch of bootstrap). This project was part of a web-dev bootcamp hosted by [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/). We were given a basic HTML file with some of the code pre-written and applied what we had learned up to that point to style and add assets to recreate the final product.
